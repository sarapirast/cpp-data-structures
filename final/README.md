- Please find each question in a separate folder under [files](/files).
- For coding questions, edit the files and check them in.

- For submission, please push your answers to Github before the deadline.
- Please ensure that all necessary header files are included in your submission.

| 1        | 30     |
| 2        | 20     |
| 3        | 30     |

- Getting 100 points from the sum of the points in this repo plus the points in Gradescope exam is considered full credit.
  - For example, if you get 80 from this repo and 25 from Gradescope, your total would be 105, which means you received full credit!
